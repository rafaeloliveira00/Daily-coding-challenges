#### Reverse Integer

### Description

Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

### Example
```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```
